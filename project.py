## Premise: Indivuals with chronic conditions can be extremly sensitive to pressure changes. While most people might not
#notice a cloudy day at all, someone with an auto immune disease might be experiencing pain or other symptoms
## Additionally, you cannot tell if pressure is going to change on most weather forecasts. Just because it will be cloudy
#does not necessarily mean there will be a significant pressure change. 

##However, if individuals with these conditions were notified ahead of time they would be able to better prepare

##The following script allows a user to input their city and find out if there will be serious pressure changes in the next day

##dr sprint- this code is running- however, i had to use copilot AI to help me with some parts (which i have noted below)
#so i would still like to review what i currently have with you :)
